Score = Σ(word_weight × frequency) - Σ(negative_word_weight × frequency)
Normalized = Score / (text_length × 0.3)
Confidence = min(|Normalized| × 2, 1)
```

## 📊 Batch Analysis

- Allows you to analyze multiple texts at once instead of one by one
- You can paste multiple lines of text (up to 50 texts per batch)
- Each line is treated as a separate text to analyze
- Efficiency: Analyze hundreds of customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses in seconds
- Time-saving: No need to copy-paste each text individually
- Bulk processing: Perfect for analyzing large datasets
- Analyzing 100+ product reviews from an e-commerce site
- Processing social media comments about a brand
- Analyzing survey responses about customer satisfaction


## 📄 Export JSON

- Exports all your analysis results in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format
- Includes text, sentiment, confidence score, and timestamp for each analysis
- Creates a structured data file that can be easily processed by other applications
- Data portability: Easy to import into other analysis tools
- API integration: Can be used with other applications or databases
- Structured data: Perfect for developers who want to build on top of your analysis
- Backup: Save your analysis results for future reference


## 📈 Export CSV

- Exports all your analysis results in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format
- Creates a spreadsheet-compatible file with columns for text, sentiment, confidence, and timestamp
- Can be opened in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application
- Spreadsheet analysis: Easy to sort, filter, and create charts in Excel/Google Sheets
- Business reporting: Perfect for creating reports and presentations
- Data visualization: Can be imported into tools like Tableau or Power BI
- Sharing: Easy to share results with colleagues or professors


## 💡 Real-World Applications

- Marketing: Analyze customer feedback across multiple channels
- Academic Research: Process large datasets for sentiment analysis studies


## 🤖 Current Implementation: Rule-Based Algorithm (Not AI)

Our sentiment analysis project currently uses a rule-based algorithm, not AI. Let me show you where this logic is implemented:

#📍 Where the "AI" Logic is Located:

- The sentiment analysis logic is in the analyzeSentiment function in src/components/SentimentAnalyzer.tsx (lines 21-104). 

## 🧠 Current Algorithm (Rule-Based):
- Word Lists: Predefined lists of positive, negative, and neutral words
- Weighted Scoring: Different weights for strong/medium/mild sentiment words
- Phrase Matching: Looks for common positive/negative phrases
- Negation Handling: Detects words like "not" and flips sentiment
- Score Normalization: Adjusts scores based on text length


## 📁 What is the dist folder?

- The dist folder (short for "distribution") contains the production-ready, optimized version of our sentiment analysis application.
- When you run npm run build, it:
  1. Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
  2. Bundles all your code into optimized files
  3. Minifies CSS and JavaScript
  4. Creates the dist folder with production files

## 📂 What's inside the dist folder:
    🎯 Uses of the dist folder:
        1. Production Deployment
            - Upload the entire dist folder to any web server
            - No need for Node.js or build tools on the server
            - Just static files that work anywhere
        2. Sharing Your Project
            - Send the dist folder to your professors
            - They can open index.html directly in any browser
            - No need to install dependencies or run commands
        3. Cross-platform Compatibility
            - Works on any operating system
            - No dependency on Node.js or npm
            - Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.
